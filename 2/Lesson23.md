# A new house

## 译文

昨天我收到了姐姐的一封信，  
她住在尼日利亚。  
在信中她说她明年将到英国来。  
如果她来了，她会感到非常惊奇的。  
我们现在住在乡间的一栋漂亮的新住宅里。  
这栋房子在我姐姐离开之前就已动工了，  
是在5个月以前竣工的。  
我在信中告诉她，她可以和我们住在一起。  
这栋房子里有许多房间，还有一个漂亮的花园。  
它是一栋非常现代化的住宅，因此在有些人看来很古怪。
它肯定是这个地区唯一的一栋现代化住宅。  

## 原文

I had a letter from my sister yesterday.  
She lives in Nigeria.  
In her letter, she said that she would come to England next year.  
If she comes, she will get a surprise.  
We are now living in a beautiful new house in the country.  
Work on it had begun before my sister left.  
The house was completed five months ago.  
In my letter, I told her that she could stay with us.  
The house has many large rooms and there is a lovely garden.  
It is a very modern house, so it looks strange to some people.  
It must be the only modern house in the district.
