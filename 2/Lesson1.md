## A private conversation

### 原文

Last week I went to the theatre. I had a very good seat. The play was very intersting. I did not enjoy it. A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me. They were talking loudly. I got very angry. I could not hear the actors. I turned round. I looked at the man and the woman angrily. They did not pay any attention. In the end, I could not bear it. I turned round again. "I can't hear a word!" I said angrily.
"It's none of your business," the young man said rudely. "This is a private conversation!"
### 参考译文

上星期我去看戏。我有个很好的位子。戏很有意思，但我却无法欣赏。一个青年男子和一个青年女子坐在我的身后，他们大声地交谈。我很生气，因为我听不见演员在说什么。我回头怒视着那一男一女，他们却毫不理会。最后，我忍不住了。我又转过头去。“我一个字也听不见了。”我生气地说。
“不关你的事，“那男的毫不客气地说，“这是私人间的谈话！”
