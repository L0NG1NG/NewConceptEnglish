# Do you speak English

## 原文

I had an amusing experience last year. After I had left a small village in the sounth of France, I drove on to the next town. On the way, a young man waved to me. I stopped and he asked me for a lift. As soon as he had got into the car, I said good moring to him in French and he replied in the same language. Apart from a few words, I do not know any French at all. Neither of us spoke during the journey. I had nearly reached the town, when the young man suddenly said, very slowly, 'Do you speak English?' As I soon learnt, he was English himself!

## 译文

去年我有过一次有趣的经历。在离开法国南部的一个小村庄后，我开车去了下一个城镇。途中，一个年轻人向我招手。我停下车，他让我顺便载他一程。他一上车，我就用法语跟他说了早上好，他也用法语回答我。除了几句话，我一点也不会法语。一路上我们都没有说话。我快到镇上时，那个年轻人突然很慢地问道：“你会说英语吗？”我很快就知道了，他自己就是英国人！
