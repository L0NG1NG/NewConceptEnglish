# Not for jazz

## 原文

We have old musical instrument. It is called a clavichord. It was made in Germany in 1681. Our clavichord is kept in the living room. It has belonged to our family for a long time. The instrument was bought by my grandfather many years ago. Recently it was damaged by a visitor. She tried to play jazz on it! She struck the keys too hard and two strings were broken. My father was shocked. Now we are not allowed to touch it. It is being repaired by a friend of my father's.
