# Percy Buttons

## 原文

I have just moved to a house in Bridge Street. Yesterday a beggar knocked at my door. He asked me for a meal and a glass of beer. In return for this, the beggar stood on his head and sang songs. I gave him a meal. He ate the food and drank the beer. Then he put a piece of cheese in his pocket and went away. Later a neighbour told me about him. Everybody knows him. His name is Percy Buttons. He calls at every house in the street once a month and always asks for a meal and a glass of beer.

## 译文

我刚搬进大桥街的一所房子。昨天一个乞丐敲我的门。他问我要一顿饭和一杯啤酒。作为回报，乞丐倒立着唱歌。我给了他一顿饭，他吃了食物喝了啤酒。然后他把一块奶酪放进口袋里走了。后来以为邻居告诉我了他的情况。大家都认识他。他叫珀西·巴顿斯。他每月都会去街上的每户人家一次，总是请求一顿饭和啤酒。
