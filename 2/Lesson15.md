# Good news

## 原文

The secretary told me that Mr.Harmsworth would see me. I felt very nervous when I went into his office. He did not look up from his desk when I entered. After I had sat down, He said that business was very bad. He told me that the firm could not afford to pay such large salaries. Twenty people had already left. I knew that my turn had come.
'Mr.Harmsworth,' I said in weak voice.
'Don't interupt,' He said.
The he smiled and told me I would receive an extra thousand pounds a year!

## 译文

秘书告诉我哈姆斯沃斯先生要见我。我走进他的办公室时感到非常紧张。我进去时他连头也没抬。我坐下后，他说生意非常不景气。他告诉我公司付不起这么高的薪水。已经有二十个人离开了。我知道这次该轮到我了。
“哈姆斯沃斯先生，”我虚弱地说道。
“别打断，”他说。
然后他笑了笑，告诉我说，我每年将得到一千英镑的额外收入！
