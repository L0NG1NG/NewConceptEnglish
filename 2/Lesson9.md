# A cold welcome

## 原文

On Wednesday evening, we went to the Town Hall. It was the last day of the year and a large crowed of people had gathered under the Town Hall clock. It would strike twelve in twenty minutes's time. Fifteen minutes passed and then, at five to twelve, the clock stopped. The big minute hand did not move. We waited and waited, but nothing happened. Suddenly someone shouted, 'It's two minutes pass twelve! The clock stopped!' I looked at my watch. It was true. The big clock refused to welcome the New Year. At that monent, everybody began laugh and sing.

星期三的晚上，我们去了市政厅。那是一年的最后一天，一大群人已经聚集在市政厅的钟下。大钟将在20分钟后敲响12下。15分钟过去了，就在11点55分时，钟停了。那个巨大的分针不动了。我们等啊等，可情况没有变化。突然有个人大喊道：“已经12点零2分了！那钟停了！”我看了我的手表，果真如此，那个大钟拒绝迎接新年。此时，大家开始笑了起来，同时唱起了歌。
