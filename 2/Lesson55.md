## 非谓语动词

要理解非谓语，需要记住一个黄金法则：**一个简单句有且只能有一个谓语**。 
如果句子里已经有一个谓语了，其他的动词想要出现，就必须变成非谓语形式。  
- 🍉 I love singing. love 是谓语（有时态变化，受主语 I 支配）。
    - singing 是非谓语（动名词，作宾语）。

### 🧬 非谓语动词的三大家族

|形式|名称|主要功能 🛠️|例子|
|---|---|---|---|
|To do|不定式 (Infinitive)|表示目的、将来或具体某次动作。|I want to swim.|
|Doing|动名词/现在分词 (Participle)|动名词侧重身份（名）；现在分词侧重主动/进行。|Swimming is fun. / The swimming boy.|
|Done|过去分词 (Past Participle)|表示被动或已经完成的状态。|The window broken by him.|

### 作用

1. 相当于名词来使用，用于主语/宾语/表语（形态为doing和to do）
    - Fishing is my favorite sport./ To fish is my favorite sport.
    - It was his job to repair bicycles.
    - I often fish for hours without **catching anything**.
    - Both men started **running through the trees**.

2. 修饰名词/句子，作定语/状语（doing/done/to do）
    - **Passing planes** can be heard night and day.
    - I was the only **passenger left on the bus.**
    - I have a lot of **homework to do.**
    - **Looking round**,I realized that I was the only passenger.
    - **Armed with the new machine**, they went into the cave.
    - I sat in the front of the bus **to get a good view...**

## 过去常常做某事

1. used to do sth.
- I used to go to work by bus. Now I go by car.(表示过去常常做某事，但是现在不这么做了，强调今非昔比)
- I used to be a student. I used to have many pen-friends.(表示过去的状态)

2. would do sth.
- 只能表示过去重复发生的动作，不能表示状态。
- 仅仅是描述过去经常发生的画面，不一定暗示现在已经停止。
- 常用于回忆往事（怀旧语气），描述在特定场景下反复发生的行为。  

When I was a child, we would go to the beach every summer.  
这种描述更有画面感，像是在讲故事。
