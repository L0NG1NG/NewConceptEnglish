# A glass envelope

## 译文

我的女儿简从未想过会接到荷兰一位同龄姑娘的来信。  
去年，当我们横渡英吉利海峡时，简把写有她姓名和住址的一张纸条装进了一只瓶子，  
又将瓶子扔进了大海。  
此后她就再没去想那只瓶子。  
但10个月以后，她收到了荷兰一位姑娘的来信。  
现在这两位姑娘定期通信了。  
然而她们还是决定利用邮局。  
这样会稍微多花点钱，但肯定是快得多了。  

## 原文

My daughter, Jane, never dreamed of receiving a letter from a girl of her own age in Holland.  
Last year, we were travelling across the Channel and Jane put a piece of paper with her name and address on it into a bottle.  
She threw the bottle into the sea.  
She never thought of it again,  
but ten months later, she received a letter from a girl in Holland.  
Both girls write to each other regularly now.  
However, they have decided to use the post office.  
Letters will cost a little more, but they will certainly travel faster.
