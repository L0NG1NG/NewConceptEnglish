## 原文

I have just received a letter from my brother, Tim. He is in Australia.He has been there for six months. Tim is an enginner. He is working for a big firm and he has already visited a great number of different places in Australia. He has just bought an Australian car and has gone to Alice Springs, a small town in the centre of Australia. He will soom visit Darwin. From there, he will fly to Perth. My brother has never abroad before, so he is finding this trip very exciting.
## 译文

我刚刚收到弟弟蒂姆的来信，她正在澳大利亚。他已经在那6个月了。蒂姆是个工程师。正在为一家大公司工作，并且已经去过澳大利亚不少地方了。他刚买了辆澳大利亚的轿车，现在去了澳大利亚中部的小镇爱丽丝春天。他不就还将到达尔文去，从那里，他将再飞往珀斯。我弟弟以前从未出过国，因此，他觉得这次旅行非常激动人心。
