# The best and the worst

## 原文

Joe Sanders has the most beautiful garden in our town. Nearly everybody enters for 'The Nicest Garden Competition' each year, but Joe wins every time. Bill Frith's garden is larger than Joe's. Bill works harder than Joe and grows more flowers and vegetables, but Joe's garden is more interesting. He has made neat paths and has built a wooden bridge over a pool. I like gardens too, but I do not like hard work. Every year I enter for the garden competition too, and I always win a little prize for the worst garden in the town!

## 译文

乔·桑德斯拥有我们镇上最美丽的花园。几乎每个人每年都参加“最漂亮花园比赛”，但乔每次都赢。比尔·弗里斯的花园比乔的要大。比尔比乔更勤奋，种植的花卉和蔬菜也更多，但乔的花园更有趣。他修建了整洁的小路，还在池塘上建了一座木桥。我也喜欢花园，但我不愿意辛勤劳动。每年我也参加花园比赛，但总因是镇上最劣的花园而获得一个小奖！
