# A polite request

## 原文

If you park your car in the wrong place, a traffic policeman will soon find it. You will be very lucky if he lets you go without a ticket. However, this does not always happen. Traffic police are sometimes very polite. During a holiday in Sweden, I found this note on my car: 'Sir, we welcome you to our city. This is a "No Parking" area. You will enjoy your stay here if you pay attention to our stree signs. This note is only a reminder' If you receive a request like this, you cannot fail to obey it
!

## 译文

如果你把车停错了地方，交警很快就会发现。如果他没给你罚款单就放你走了，那你就太幸运了。然而，这种情况并不总是发生。交警有时非常有礼貌。在瑞典度假期间，我在车上发现了这张纸条：“先生，欢迎您来到我们的城市。此处是‘禁止停车’区。如果你对我们的街上的标牌稍加注意，你会在这里过得很愉快。这张纸条只是提醒。”如果你收到这样的要求，你是不会不遵照执行的！
