# Too late

## 原文

The plane was late and detectives were wating at the airport all moring. They were expecting a valuable parcel of diamonds from South Africa. A few hours earlier, someone had told the police that thieves would try to steal the diamonds When the plane arrived, some of the detectivies were wating in side the main building while others were wating on the airfield. Two men took the parcel off the plane and carried it into the Customs House. While two detectivies were keeping guard at the door, two others opened the parcel. To their suprise, the precious parcel was full of stones and sand!
