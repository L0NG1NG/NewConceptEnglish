# One good turn deserves another

## 原文

I was having dinner at a restaurant when Tony Steele came in. Tony worked in a lawyer's office years ago, but he is now working at a bank. He gets a good salary, but he always borrows money from his friends and never pays it back. Tony saw me and came and sat at the smae table. He has never borrowed money form me. While he was eating, I asked him to lend me twenty pounds. To my surprise, he gave me the money immediatety. 'I have never borrowed any money from you,' Tony said, 'so now you can pay for my dinner!'

## 译文

我正在一家餐馆吃饭，托尼·斯蒂尔走了进来。托尼几年前在一家律师事务所工作，但现在在一家银行工作。他的薪水很高，但他总是向朋友借钱，而且从不还钱。托尼看到我，就过来和我坐在同一张桌子前。他从未向我借过钱。吃饭的时候，我提出向他借二十英镑。令我惊讶的是，他立即把钱给了我。“我从来没有向你借过钱，”托尼说，“所以现在你可以替我付饭钱了！”
