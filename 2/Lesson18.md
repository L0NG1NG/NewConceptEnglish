# He often does this!

## 原文

After I had had lunch at a village pub, I looked for my bag.  
I had left it on a chair beside the door and now it wasn't there!  
As I was looking for it, the landlord came in.  
'Did you have a good meal?' he asked.  
'Yes, thank you,' I answered, 'but I can't pay the bill. I haven't got my bag.'  
The landlord smiled and immediately went out.  
In a few minutes he returned with my bag and gave it back to me.  
'I'm very sorry,' he said. 'My dog had taken it into the garden. He often does this!'
