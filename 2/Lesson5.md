# No wrong numbers

## 原文

Mr.James Scott has a garage in Sibury and now he has just bought another garage in Pinhurst. Pinhurst is only five miles from Silbury, but Mr.Scott cannot get a telephone for his new garage, so he has just bought twelve pigeons. Yesterday, a pigeon carried the first message from Pinhurst to Silbury. The bird covered the distance in three minutes. Up to now, Mr.Scott has sent a great many requests for spare parts and other urgent messages from one garage to the other. In  this way, he has begun his own private 'telephone' service.

## 译文

詹姆斯·斯科特先生在西伯里有一个修车厂，现在他又在平赫斯特买了另一个修车厂。平赫斯特距离西尔伯里只有五英里，但斯科特先生无法为他的修车厂安装电话，所以他刚买了十二只鸽子。昨天，一只鸽子把第一封信从平赫斯特带到了西尔伯里。这只鸽子在三分钟内飞完了这段距离。到目前为止，斯科特先生已经从一个修车厂向另一个修车厂发送了大量备件请求和其他紧急信息。就这样，他开始了自己的私人“电话”服务。
