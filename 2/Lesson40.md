## if虚拟条件句

if虚拟条件句 假设现在  
口诀：if往前推,主句4+1  

🍉 往前推：将假设现在的事(一般现在时)往前推一个时态变为过去式，动词变成did或were(虽然be动词的过去式有was和were，但是在虚拟当中只能用were),从而来表示虚拟。
🍉 4+1：主句由 could/would/should/might 这四个词任选一个 + do 构成  

----

例句：

- If I were you, I could/would/should/might not be so confident.(如果我是你，我可能就没这么自信)
- What would you do if you won a lot of money?
- He would enjoy this if he were present.
