# Taxi

## 译文

本.弗西特机长买了一辆不同寻常的出租汽车，并开始了一项新的业务。  
这辆“出租汽车”是一架小型瑞士飞机，叫“皮勒特斯.波特”号。  
这架奇妙的飞机可以载7名乘客。  
然而，最令人惊奇的是它能够在任何地方降落：雪地上，水面上，甚至刚耕过的田里。  
弗西特机长的第一名乘客是位医生，他从伯明翰飞往威尔士山区一个偏僻的村庄。  
从那时开始，弗西特机长已经载送乘客到过许多不寻常的地方。  
一次，他把飞机降落在了一栋公寓楼的屋顶上；还有一次，降落在了一个废弃的停车场上。  
弗西特机长刚刚拒绝了一位商人的奇怪要求。  
这个人想要飞往大西洋上的一个孤岛 -- 罗卡尔岛，  
弗西特机长之所以不送他去，是因为那段飞行太危险了。  

## 原文

Captain Ben Fawcett has bought an unusual taxi and has begun a new service.  
The ‘taxi’ is a small Swiss aeroplane called a ‘Pilatus Porter’.  
This wonderful plane can carry seven passengers.  
The most surprising thing about it, however, is that it can land anywhere: on snow, water, or even on a ploughed field.  
Captain Fawcett's first passenger was a doctor who flew from Birmingham to a lonely village in the Welsh mountains.  
Since then, Captain Fawcett has flown passengers to many unusual places.  
Once he landed on the roof of a block of flats and on another occasion, he landed in a deserted car park.  
Captain Fawcett has just refused a strange request from a businessman.  
The man wanted to fly to Rockall, a lonely island in the Atlantic Ocean,  
but Captain Fawcett did not take him because the trip was too dangerous.
